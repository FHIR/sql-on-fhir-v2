# SQL on FHIR API


## Overview

This document defines a standard HTTP API for interacting with SQL on FHIR systems, 
including FHIR servers and ViewDefinition runners.

This is a normative specification that defines conformance 
requirements for implementing ViewDefinition functionality in compliant systems.

The following list of API endpoints are defined:

- CapabilityStatement API
- Bulk Export API
- ViewDefinition discovery API
- ViewDefinition management API
- ViewDefinition runner API


## Use Cases


### Use Case 1: Discovery

Clients can discover supported capabilities of the server by requesting the CapabilityStatement resource
on standard FHIR server endpoint - `/metadata`.

* Discover supported operations
* Discover supported ViewDefinitions
* Discover supported output formats

[See CapabilityStatement](#capabilitystatement)

### Use Case 2: Bulk Export for Reporting and Analysis

Clients can efficiently transform and export FHIR data in flattened format (csv, parquet, ndjson) 
described in ViewDefinitions into file storage (like S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage, etc).
And use standard tools like Apache Spark, AWS Athena or other tools to analyze data or load data into data warehouses.

**Flow:**

1. The client initiates an asynchronous bulk export operation by submitting 
   a list of ViewDefinitions to the server or SQL on FHIR facade on top of existing FHIR servers.
2. The server:
   - Processes the ViewDefinitions
   - Exports results in CSV and/or Parquet formats to file storage 
   - Responds with URLs for accessing the exported files
3. The client can then:
   - Load the exported files into a data warehouse
   - Analyze them using tools like Apache Spark or Amazon Athena


[See Async Bulk Export](#async-bulk-export)

### Use Case 3: Real-time Evaluation of ViewDefinition

Client can request real-time evaluation of ViewDefinition and process streamed results. For example, 
AI applications can use this to process patient data in real-time by requesting flat conditions, 
observations and medications as they are recorded.

**Flow:**

1. The client initiates a real-time evaluation of a ViewDefinition by submitting it to the server.
2. The server:
   - Processes the ViewDefinition
   - Responds with the results of the evaluation
3. The client can process streamed results on fly.

[See Run ViewDefinition](#run-viewdefinition)

### Use Case 4: Authoring & Debugging ViewDefinition

Developers or developer tools can test and refine ViewDefinitions interactively by evaluating them in real-time.

**Flow:**

1. The client initiates a real-time evaluation of a ViewDefinition by submitting it to the server.
2. The server:
   - Processes the ViewDefinition
   - Responds with the results of the evaluation

[See Run ViewDefinition](#run-viewdefinition)

### Use Case 5: Bulk Reports and Analytics

Client can submit an asynchronous job to the server to build views and run queries to 
produce reports, quality dashboards and analytics. What's going on server is abstracted from the client.
Administrative bodies can request bulk reports for different populations and metrics from hospital systems.

**Flow:**

1. The client initiates an asynchronous request to run queries on specific views.
2. The server:
   - Processes the request
   - Builds views and runs queries
   - Responds with the results
3. The client can poll results

[See Run Bulk Queries](#run-bulk-queries)

## API

### CapabilityStatement

CapabilityStatement for Bulk Export API.

```http
GET /CapabilityStatement HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/fhir+json
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/fhir+json

{
  "resourceType": "CapabilityStatement",
  "name": "BulkExport",
  "description": "Bulk Export API",
  "url": "https://example.com/bulk-export",

              "definition": "http://sql-on-fhir.org/OperationDefinition/$export"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
}
```

### Async Bulk Export

Bulk export endpoint accepts list of ViewDefinitions to export 
and returns list of export tasks.

Bulk Export API consists of 4 endpoints:

- Start export
- Get export status
- Cancel export
- Get export results

#### Start export

**endpoint:** `POST ViewDefinition/$export`

Start export of views.

**parameters:** :

- **view** - List of Canonical URLs of ViewDefinitions to export
- **library** - Canonical URL of Library with list of ViewDefinitions
- **bundle** - URL of FHIR Bundle with ViewDefinition resources
- **format** - MIMe type of the export:
  - `text/csv` - comma separated values
  - `application/fhir+ndjson` - newline delimited JSON
  - `application/parquet` - Apache Parquet
- **identifier** - (optional) Unique identifier of the export
- **patient** - (optional) reference to Patient to export
- **group** - (optional) reference to Group to export
- **source** - (optional) Name of source to export, interpreted by server
- **destination** - (optional) Name of destination to export, interpreted by server

**response:**

- `status` - status of the export
- `location` - location to poll for status
- `body` - optional OperationOutcome


##### Request

```http
POST ViewDefinition/$export HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "identifier",
      "valueIdentifier": {
        "system": "ETL",

  ]
}

```

##### Response - Success

* HTTP Status Code of `202 Accepted`
* Content-Location header with the absolute URL of an endpoint for subsequent status requests (polling location)
  TODO: Should it be absolute or relative?  it's easy for server to return relative URL.
  Absolute url is more flexible and easier to use for client.
* Optionally, a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in the body in JSON format

##### Response - Error (e.g., unsupported search parameter)

* HTTP Status Code of `4XX` or `5XX`
* The body SHALL be a FHIR OperationOutcome resource in JSON format

* not supported parameters
* not supported view definitions


#### Get export status

Get status of the export. Server may report status - ready, in-progress, failed, cancelled.

**endpoint:** `GET {Location}`
**responses:**

##### `202 Accepted` - **in-progress** - true if export is in progress

#### Cancel export

**Endpoint:** `DELETE {Location}`

#### Pause and restart export?

**Endpoint** `PUT {Location]/disable` - pauses the export

**Endpoint** `PUT {Location]/enable` - (re)-enables the export.

#### Get export results


### Run ViewDefinition

Real-time (synchronous) API for running ViewDefinitions.  This operation returns results immediately (may use chunking-encoding).

This operation may be invoked at the type level - e.g. `ViewDefinition/$run`, or at the instance level - e.g. `ViewDefinition/{id}/$run`  If `$run` is invoked at the type level, the ViewDefinition is to be supplied by the client in the request.  If `$run` is invoked at the instance level, the ViewDefinition identified in the path shall be used. 


#### POST ViewDefinition/$run

Evaluates one or more ViewDefinition resources in the request body as a FHIR `Parameter` and returns results immediately.

**Endpoint:** `POST ViewDefinition/$run`

**Headers:**
- Accept: 
  - `text/csv`
  - `text/csv;header=present`
  - `application/json`
  - `application/ndjson`
  - `application/parquet`

**Query Parameters:**

| Name    | Type         | Cardinality | Description                                                               |
|---------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _format | string       | 0..1 | Specifies the response media type - see `Accept` header.                   |
| _header | boolean      | 0..1 | This parameter only applies to `text/csv` requests.  `present` (default) - return headers in the response, `absent` - do not return headers.  |
| viewReference | Reference | 0..* | Reference(s) to ViewDefinition(s) to be used for data transformation.  |
| viewResource | ViewDefinition | 0..* | ViewDefinition(s) to be used for data transformation.              |
| patient | Reference    | 0..* | When provided, the server SHALL NOT return resources in the patient compartments belonging to patients outside of this list. If a client requests patients who are not present on the server (or in the case of a group level `$run` operation, who are not members of the group), the server SHOULD return details via a FHIR `OperationOutcome` resource in an error response to the request.<br><br>A server that is unable to support `patient` SHOULD return an error and FHIR `OperationOutcome` resource so the client can re-submit a request omitting the patient parameter. | 
| group   | Reference    | 0..* | When provided, the server SHALL NOT return resources that are not a member of the supplied `Group`. <br><br>A server that is unable to support `group` SHOULD return an error and FHIR `OperationOutcome` resource so the client can re-submit a request omitting the group parameter. |
| source  | string       | 0..1 | If provided, the source of FHIR data to be transformed into a tabular projection.  `source` may be interpreted as implementation specific and may be a Uri, a bucket name, or another method acceptable to the server.  If `source` is absent, the transformation is performed on the data that resides in the FHIR server.   |
| _count  | number       | 0..1 | Limits the number of results, equivalent to FHIR search `_count` parameter.     |
| _page   | number       | 0..1 | Page number for paginated results, equivalent to FHIR search `_page` parameter. |
| _since  | FHIR Instant | 0..1 | Resources will be included in the response if their state has changed after the supplied time (e.g., if Resource.meta.lastUpdated is later than the supplied `_since` time). In the case of a Group level export, the server MAY return additional resources modified prior to the supplied time if the resources belong to the patient compartment of a patient added to the Group after the supplied time (this behavior SHOULD be clearly documented by the server). For Patient- and Group-level requests, the server MAY return resources that are referenced by the resources being returned regardless of when the referenced resources were last updated. For resources where the server does not maintain a last updated time, the server MAY include these resources in a response irrespective of the `_since` value supplied by a client. |
