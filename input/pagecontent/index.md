_This is an evolution of the original "SQL on FHIR" draft, which can
[still be found here](https://github.com/FHIR/sql-on-fhir-archived)._

### Intro
The [FHIR®](https://hl7.org/fhir) standard is a great fit for RESTful and JSON-based
systems, helping make healthcare data liquidity real. This spec aims to take FHIR usage a step
futher, making FHIR work well with familiar and efficient SQL engines and surrounding ecosystems.

We do this by creating simple, tabular *views* of the underlying FHIR data that are tailored
to specific needs. Views are defined with [FHIRPath](https://hl7.org/fhirpath/) expressions in
a logical structure to specify things like column names and unnested items.

Let's start with a simple example, defining a "patient_demographics" view with the following
[ViewDefinition](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) structure:

```js
{
  "name": "patient_demographics",
  "resource": "Patient",
  "select": [
    {
      "column": [
        {
          "path": "getResourceKey()",
          "name": "id"
        },
        {
          "path": "gender",
          "name": "gender"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      // Create columns from the official name selected here.
      "forEach": "name.where(use = 'official').first()",
      "column": [
        {
          "path": "given.join(' ')",
          "name": "given_name",
          "description": "A single given name field with all names joined together."
        },
        {
          "path": "family",
          "name": "family_name"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This will result in a "patient_demographics" table that looks like this. The table can be persisted and queried
in your database of choice, using the view name as the table name:

| id | gender | given_name    | family_name |
|----|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1  | female | Malvina Gerda | Vicario     |
| 2  | male   | Yolotzin Adel | Bristow     |
| 3  | other  | Jin Gomer     | Aarens      |
{:.table-data}

Such tabular views can be created for any FHIR resource, with
[more examples here](artifacts.html#example-example-instances). See the
[View Definition page](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) for the full definition
of the above structure.

### View Definition non-goals
View Definitions are intentionally constrained to a narrow set of functionality to make them easily
and broadly implementable, while deferring higher-level capabilities to database engines or processing
pipelines that solve those problems well. Therefore it's important to know what View Definitions
do *not* do, by design:

#### A single View Definition will not join different resources in any way
A single View Definition defines a tabular view of exactly one resource type, like a view of `Patient`
or a view of `Condition` resources. Any joins between resources are exclusively in downstream systems,
like between database tables computed by view definitions. This makes it possible for a wide set of
FHIR infrastructure to implement this spec, and lets database engines or processing pipelines join as
needed.

#### View Definitions do not have sorting, aggregation, or limit capabilities
View Definitions define only the logical schema of views, and therefore defer sorting, aggergation or limit
operations to engines, along with cross-view joins. *View Runners* (described below) or future FHIR
server operations may accept limits or sort columns as part of their operations, so users at runtime can
specify what they need dynamically and independently of the definition of the view itself.

#### View Definitions are not aware of output formats
View Definitions themselves are independent of any tech stack and therefore unaware of the output format.
*View Runners* are the component that applies definitions to a particular stack, producing output like
a database table, Parquet file, CSV, or another format specific to the runner.


### System Layers

The [View Definition](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) is the central element of this
spec, but in practice it is really one layer of an overall system. The layers are:

- the *Data Layer*
- the *View Layer*
- and the *Analytics Layer*.

### The Data Layer
The *Data Layer* is a set of lossless representations that collectively enable FHIR
to be used with a wide variety of different query technologies. It may
optionally be persisted and annotated to make it or implementations of the view
layer more efficient, but no specific Data Layer structure will be required by
this specification.

Implementations are encouraged but not required to further annotate the FHIR
resources to help View layer implementations run efficient queries. This
primarily applies when the underlying FHIR resources are stored in databases
that the View layer will query.

### The View Layer
The *View Layer* defines portable, tabular views of FHIR data that can more easily
be consumed by a wide variety of analytic tools. The use of these tools is
described in *Analytics Layer* section. Our goal here is simply to get
the needed FHIR data in a form that matches user needs and common analytic
patterns.

The View Layer itself has two key components:

* *View Definitions*, allowing users to define flattened views of FHIR data that
are portable between systems.
* *View Runners* are system-specific tools or libraries that apply view definitions to
the underlying data layer, optionally making use of annotations to optimize performance.

See the [View Definition documentation](StructureDefinition-ViewDefinition.html) for details and examples; 
these are the central piece of this specification.

View Runners will be specific to the data
layer they use. Each data layer may have one or more corresponding view
runners, but a given View Definition can be run by many runners over many
data layers.

Example view runners may include:

* A runner that creates a virtual, tabular view in an analytic database
* A runner that queries FHIR JSON directly and creates a table in a web application
* A runner that loads data directly into a notebook or other data analysis tool

#### Generating Schemas
The output of many runners will have technology-specific schemas, such as database table
definitions or schema for structured files like Parquet. This will be runner- and technology-
specific, but runner implementaitons SHOULD offer a way to compute that schema from a ViewDefinition
when applicable.

For example, a runner that produces a table in a database system could return a "CREATE TABLE" or
"CREATE VIEW" statement based on the ViewDefinition, allowing the system to define tables prior to 
populating them by evaluating the views over data.

This would not apply to outputs that do not have common a schema specification, like CSV files. 

### The Analytics Layer

Finally, users must be able to easily leverage the above views with the analytic
tools of their choice. This spec purposefully does not define what these are,
but common use cases may be SQL queries by consuming applications, dataframe-based
data science tools in Python or R, or integration with business intelligence tools.
