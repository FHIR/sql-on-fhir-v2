This ViewDefinition is designed for FHIR R4 Encounter resources. Since this
Implementation Guide is built with FHIR R5, the example output cannot be
dynamically generated. The view would produce a table with the following
columns when executed against R4 data:

| id | status | patient_id | service_org_id | period_start | period_end | EpisodeOfCareId | type_sys | type_code | practitioner_id | location_id |
|----|--------|------------|----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
